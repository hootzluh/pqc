# PQC Implementations

[X] 01. pqcrypto/ → Native Rust (desktop/server).

[X] 02. pqwasm/ → Browser WASM.

[X] 03. pqnodejs/ → Node.js WASM.

[X] 04. pqwasi/ → WASI runtimes (serverless/edge).

[X] 05. pqmobile/ → iOS/Android cross-compiled builds.

[X] 06. pqwear/ → Wearable devices (smart watches, rings, fitness trackers) - lightweight implementations for resource-constrained devices.

[ ] 07. pqplatform/ → Smart TV and smart home platforms (tvOS, Android TV, Google Home/Assistant, Apple HomePod/HomeOS).

[ ] 08. pqspatial/ → Spatial computing platforms (AR/VR/MR) - real-time optimized for spatial computing with Vision Pro, Meta Quest, etc. 

[ ] 09. pqnostd/ → IoT & Embedded (Rust no_std, ARM Cortex, ESP32).
